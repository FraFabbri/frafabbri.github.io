I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student at UPF, Barcelona, working mainly on Algorithmic Fairness, with a particular focus on Recommender Systems. 

I'm supported by the Vicente LÃ³pez scholarship, awarded by [Eurecat, Research Center in Catalunya](https://eurecat.org/) and I'm luckily advised by Dr. [Francesco Bonchi](http://www.francescobonchi.com) and Prof. [Carlos Castillo](https://chato.cl).

Prior to start my PhD, I've been awarded with a full grant to participate the 8 weeks study program in Artificial Intelligence at [Pi School](https://picampus-school.com/programme/school-of-ai/), Rome, Italy.

I received my Master's Degree (Honours) in Data Science and Bachelor of Science in Statistics from Sapienza, University of Rome. 

During my study I've been awarded with a research scholarship at DIAG (Department of Computer, Control and Management Engineering), concerning the development and application of data analysis techniques in bibliometrics.
